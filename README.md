This is the beginning of your personal, local, intelligent, autonomous system AI assistant for game cheating, reverse engineering, and whatever tasks you want.

Repos goals:
- Real-time, responsive local model
- Game cheating modules: process attachment, memory scanning, data mods, pointer scanning
- Reverse engineering analysis, with ASM/disassemblier analysis
- File organization, desktop usage, app scripts, mod controls
- Gui: Dear PyGui based with modules for all tasks
- System command shell, file operations, automated tasks and profiles,
- AI interface: chat window, memory, code output, action calls

This will be developed in phases, as modules. You can activate specific functions, train behavior, and extend its smarts over time.
